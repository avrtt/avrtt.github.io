The overarching notion that a system can be described where "future" states depend solely on the "present" state — while ignoring specific details of how the process arrived in that state — offers a mathematically appealing and computationally tractable way of modeling a wide array of phenomena. These phenomena range from language modeling in natural language processing to user behavior in recommender systems, and from weather forecasting to high-tempo financial markets transitions.

The Markov property can be extended or relaxed in many ways, leading to partially observed or hidden Markov models, hierarchical or layered structures, or continuous-state Markov processes.

The latter scenario is covered by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which have been famously applied to speech recognition and many other time-series tasks. Indeed, the widespread success of HMMs in speech, language modeling, and bioinformatics has established these models as a canonical approach for problems where the data is sequential or temporal in nature. Not surprisingly, modern deep learning pipelines also frequently incorporate Markov assumptions or Markov-inspired modules, though they might wrap them in more complex function approximators like recurrent neural networks or attention-based transformers.

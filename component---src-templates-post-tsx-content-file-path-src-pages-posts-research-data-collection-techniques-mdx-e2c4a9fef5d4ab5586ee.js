We'll explore using scrapers, dealing with dynamic content, and tapping into the vast ecosystem of open APIs. Moving forward, I will discuss external and third-party datasets, ranging from public government repositories to subscription-based platforms. Next, we'll dive into experimental data collection — how to set up data-generating procedures, maintain controls, and ensure reproducibility. Finally, I will examine the interplay between data quality, data cleaning, and the ultimate storage solutions that keep your pipeline organized and future-proof.

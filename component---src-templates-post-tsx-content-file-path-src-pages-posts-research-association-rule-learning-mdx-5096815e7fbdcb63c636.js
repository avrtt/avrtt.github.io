It originated in the field of market basket analysis, where retailers were interested in finding product co-occurrences in shopping carts to identify which products tend to be purchased together. From that original retail perspective, association rule learning has expanded into numerous other domains, such as web usage mining, product recommendations, social network analysis, bioinformatics, text analysis, and more. Today, these methods are recognized as fundamental tools in exploratory data analysis for uncovering patterns and enabling data-driven decision-making."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,'The central idea is to search through datasets, sometimes extremely large ones, to reveal sets of items (or events, or attributes) that frequently co-occur in some meaningful way. Each discovered pattern can often be translated into an "if-then" rule that states, for example, "If a person buys bread and butter, then they are likely to buy milk."

The richness of association rule learning techniques, from Apriori to FP-growth and beyond, ensures that a wide spectrum of tasks can benefit from the deeper insights these powerful methods can uncover."))}var o=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},(0,a.RP)(),e.components);return t?i.createElement(t,e,i.createElement(s,e)):s(e)},c=n(54506),m=n(88864),u=n(58481),h=n.n(u),d=n(5984),p=n(43672),f=n(27042),g=n(72031),E=n(81817),v=n(27105),y=n(17265),b=n(2043),w=n(95751),x=n(94328),A=n(80791),_=n(78137);const S=e=>{let{toc:t}=e;if(!t||!t.items)return null;return i.createElement("nav",{className:A.R},i.createElement("ul",null,t.items.map(((e,t)=>i.createElement("li",{key:t},i.createElement("a",{href:e.url,onClick:t=>((e,t)=>{e.preventDefault();const n=t.replace("#",""),a=document.getElementById(n);a&&a.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth",block:"start"})})(t,e.url)},e.title),e.items&&i.createElement(S,{toc:{items:e.items}}))))))};function k(e){let{data:{mdx:t,allMdx:l,allPostImages:r},children:s}=e;const{frontmatter:o,body:m,tableOfContents:u}=t,g=o.index,A=o.slug.split("/")[1],k=l.nodes.filter((e=>e.frontmatter.slug.includes(`/${A}/`))).sort(((e,t)=>e.frontmatter.index-t.frontmatter.index)),H=k.findIndex((e=>e.frontmatter.index===g)),T=k[H+1],C=k[H-1],q=o.slug.replace(/\/$/,""),I=/[^/]*$/.exec(q)[0],M=`posts/${A}/content/${I}/`,{0:z,1:P}=(0,i.useState)(o.flagWideLayoutByDefault),{0:L,1:V}=(0,i.useState)(!1);var F;(0,i.useEffect)((()=>{V(!0);const e=setTimeout((()=>V(!1)),340);return()=>clearTimeout(e)}),[z]),"adventures"===A?F=y.cb:"research"===A?F=y.Qh:"thoughts"===A&&(F=y.T6);const B=h()(m).replace(/import .*?

In subsequent decades, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) replaced simpler heuristic methods and became the backbone of most commercial large-vocabulary speech recognition systems. Statistical methods, combined with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for acoustic modeling and N-gram-based language models, dominated the field. Around 2012, a major shift occurred when neural networks (particularly deep networks) began outperforming GMM-based acoustic models, thanks to improved computing power, large-scale datasets, and new training techniques.

Over the past 30 years, the field of music generation has rapidly evolved, not just in terms of the complexity of the models involved, but also in the ambition of the goals pursued: from simple monophonic melodies to sophisticated polyphonic orchestrations and full-fledged audio tracks that strive for creativity and authenticity."),"\n",r.createElement(t.p,null,"Today, if you scroll through social media or software development forums, you might find demos of generative systems that can produce anything from short musical motifs to multi-minute orchestral pieces.

Researchers and enthusiasts alike continue exploring ways to capture the elusive nature of creativity and aesthetic preference in purely algorithmic forms.

Transformers introduced the concept of attention, allowing a model to directly relate any part of a sequence to any other part, enabling easier modeling of extended context. However, vanilla transformers have a memory complexity that grows quadratically with sequence length, leading to ongoing research in more efficient architectures (e.g., Performer, Linformer, Reformer) that reduce the computational overhead.

In other words, the goal is to produce a single, new image that simultaneously resembles the structure of a "content image" (often a photograph) and the visual aesthetics — or painterly style — of a separate "style image" (for instance, a famous artwork). The procedure leverages deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their learned feature representations to disentangle the concept of content from that of style.'),"\n",r.createElement(t.p,null,"Historically, neural style transfer is most commonly associated with Gatys and gang (2015) who introduced a pioneering approach that formulated the style transfer task as an iterative optimization problem on the pixel space of an initially random image, guided by carefully designed style and content loss functions.

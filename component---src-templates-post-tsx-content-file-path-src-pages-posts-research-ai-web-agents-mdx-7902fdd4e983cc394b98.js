Thanks to recent breakthroughs, such as large language models like GPT (Brown and gang, NeurIPS 2020) or vision-transformer-based recognition tools (Dosovitskiy and gang, ICLR 2021), modern web agents can integrate multiple modalities (text, audio, images, etc.) and produce context-aware, real-time, and personalized interactions."),"\n",i.createElement(n.p,null,"Historically, web agents started as simple scripts or rule-based automations that parsed HTML pages and performed keyword-based tasks.

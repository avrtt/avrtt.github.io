Each branch takes a different input, generating embeddings that are then compared using a distance function or similarity measure.",zoom:"false"}),"\n",i.createElement(a.p,null,'Siamese neural networks represent a unifying principle in machine learning: learning a shared representation that can be applied consistently for measuring similarity across any domain. By leveraging robust shared backbones, contrastive or related losses, and carefully balanced training pairs, practitioners can unlock advanced capabilities in face recognition, image retrieval, text matching, signature verification, and beyond. Because the approach is highly modular, it adapts well to the continual evolution of deep learning architectures, ensuring that the fundamental concept of "comparing features by learning them" continues to be relevant at the frontier of artificial intelligence research.'))}var l=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});const{wrapper:a}=Object.assign({},(0,n.RP)(),e.components);return a?i.createElement(a,e,i.createElement(o,e)):o(e)};var c=t(54506),h=t(88864),m=t(58481),d=t.n(m),p=t(5984),u=t(43672),g=t(27042),f=t(72031),v=t(81817),b=t(27105),y=t(17265),w=t(2043),k=t(95751),E=t(94328),S=t(80791),x=t(78137);const H=e=>{let{toc:a}=e;if(!a||!a.items)return null;return i.createElement("nav",{className:S.R},i.createElement("ul",null,a.items.map(((e,a)=>i.createElement("li",{key:a},i.createElement("a",{href:e.url,onClick:a=>((e,a)=>{e.preventDefault();const t=a.replace("#",""),n=document.getElementById(t);n&&n.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth",block:"start"})})(a,e.url)},e.title),e.items&&i.createElement(H,{toc:{items:e.items}}))))))};function z(e){let{data:{mdx:a,allMdx:r,allPostImages:s},children:o}=e;const{frontmatter:l,body:h,tableOfContents:m}=a,f=l.index,S=l.slug.split("/")[1],z=r.nodes.filter((e=>e.frontmatter.slug.includes(`/${S}/`))).sort(((e,a)=>e.frontmatter.index-a.frontmatter.index)),T=z.findIndex((e=>e.frontmatter.index===f)),_=z[T+1],C=z[T-1],M=l.slug.replace(/\/$/,""),I=/[^/]*$/.exec(M)[0],N=`posts/${S}/content/${I}/`,{0:A,1:V}=(0,i.useState)(l.flagWideLayoutByDefault),{0:L,1:B}=(0,i.useState)(!1);var P;(0,i.useEffect)((()=>{B(!0);const e=setTimeout((()=>B(!1)),340);return()=>clearTimeout(e)}),[A]),"adventures"===S?P=y.cb:"research"===S?P=y.Qh:"thoughts"===S&&(P=y.T6);const q=d()(h).replace(/import .*?

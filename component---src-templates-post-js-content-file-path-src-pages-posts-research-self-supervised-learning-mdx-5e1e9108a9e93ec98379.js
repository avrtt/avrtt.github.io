At its heart, self-supervised learning aims to devise a strategy by which an algorithm can "learn" meaningful representations of data without the expensive requirement of manual labeling. This is accomplished by creating synthetic or automatic "pseudo-labels" for a so-called pretext task, enabling a model to learn generalized features. Those features can then be transferred to downstream tasks (e.g., classification, detection, regression) that require only relatively little labeled data. In practice, many real-world applications have abundant unlabeled examples.

*"Nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life."*

So, I don't understand anything about website building, but I'll try to make it more complex in the future. Maybe that's how I'll learn. This is now my own personal platform, and I can write absolutely anything I want and how I want, no one will ever ban me like on those stupid social media sites.

Here (in this section of the site), I'll be writing neither about website building nor downshifting, but artificial intelligence — my current career path, roughly speaking.

## The world needs more nerds

AI is a longstanding interest for me within philosophy and ethics, and now I've finally taken on applied questions, including making it possible to earn remotely at any time right from [my hobo travels](/adventures/venturing_forth). <StickerPack sticker="pepe_wink"/>

I think we need AGI. I want to believe that in the next 5 years it will be possible to automate most of the routine and near-creative work. For instance, coding will become modular prompting plus human validation, instead of long reading and rewriting thousands of lines manually by a programmer. Personally, this would be a gift for me: I don't like to write code for a long time, but I like to come up with solutions that work immediately. 

The knowledge needed to develop AI must be accessible and understandable. That's why I want to dedicate Research posts to clear, simple, pleasantly readable explanations of AI concepts — both basic and complex. This world needs more people who understand AI, because AI is clearly our future, and it's something that people will have to work with whether they want to or not. Many will legitimately lose careers or businesses — just because they didn't foresee the need to incorporate AI into their lives. Creative professions, for example, will continue to be needed, but only with the ability to prompt models. Not many people understand this, unfortunately.

So, my little mission here is to study and systematize as much as possible to bring knowledge and experience, my mistakes, to other people, to give them this for free for the good of science, to contribute into popularization of important questions and tools.

We, the young, are the future of humanity, and we have to deal with the gravest ethical, technical, economic, political, and social implications of the rapid development of computer science. To do this, **we need more nerds, not reactionary**. Just so that [something doesn't quietly go wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diboERFAjkE).

*I'll come back here after a while to expand the post by outlining what I learned about research itself.*

					<M text="# üîÄ THE WAY THINGS GET DONE "/>
					<M text="### üöÄ General prerequisites"/>
					<p id="freelanceWorkflowItem">
						<M text="Before contacting me, I recommend you to check the [Services](/freelance/services) page, determine what kind of job your request refers to and learn the specifics of the chosen service (get to know the methodology, tools, workflow and so on). This will help you to formulate your preferences better and thus help me to fulfill your requirements more precisely. Don't worry: we can also agree on a non-conventional approach to the problem ‚Äî this is merely a helper page for setting the direction of our further interaction."/>
						<M text="Once you're done, drop me a message using any convenient option from the ones listed above. Please, try to describe the subject of the problem in **one message**."/>
						<M text="I'll let you know about my decision within a few hours. It can be any of the following: **a)** we immediately proceed to discussing the task; **b)** I agree to discuss the task, but when I'll be free (with providing the approximate dates); **c)** I'm not available/willing to consider the task (I leave myself the right not to disclose the reasons, but as a rule these tasks are either too demanding, don't fit my competence, or are too simple against my current bigger projects)."/>
						<M text="The following step-by-step workflow explains how I interact with clients depending on the type and complexity of the problem, the tools available, and the client's preferences. It varies under certain conditions."/>
					</p>
					<M text="### ‚úç Step 1: Discussion"/>
					<p id="freelanceWorkflowItem">
						<M text="Sometimes projects are quite complicated, so clear problem definition and thorough discussion with the customer is a must. The results of negotiations at this point will set the terms, deadline and price (preliminary or final). Typically, this is where an agreement is established: prior to prepayment, either party may reject the terms and quit the deal."/>
						<M text="**My task** is to estimate my capabilities, figure out deadlines and outline the work, and the **customer's task** is to describe the desired result in as much detail as possible. If the customer isn't a technical specialist, I'll help with interpreting. Well-written terms of reference prevent intermediate clarifications, but this isn't a necessity for ordinary level projects."/>
						<M text="For convenience, we can communicate by text or audio/video call. In practice, small projects are usually described by text, while the brainstorming of business ideas for development of technical project scope is done through 1:1 calls."/>
					</p>
					<M text="### üßê Step 2: Free expert review"/>
					<p id="freelanceWorkflowItem">
						<M text="Depending on the complexity and type of project, I offer a free expert review, immediately (during the discussion) or within a day. I analyze the technical complexity and data, selecting the best tools and strategies. I then provide full information on upcoming work costs, non-obvious steps and pitfalls, and, if adjustments are required, a **final price**. I consult the customer, giving a clear explanation of the best possible solutions, which aslo makes it easier to understand what I'll be doing during the job."/>
					</p>
					<M text="### ü§ù Step 3: Prepayment"/>
					<p id="freelanceWorkflowItem">
						<M text="I charge **50%** upfront when working with **new clients** and never take any other intermediate payments. Rarely, it may be more convenient to arrange a **hourly fee**: there is no upfront fee in this case, and new clients are charged at the end of each working day."/>
						<M text="Payment details are listed below on this page (see **Payment methods**), or they will be given in conversation. I will start working exactly **from the moment the prepayment is received**, and will keep the sum until the end of the project just in case it has to be returned."/>
						<M text="Keep in mind that this page describes paying without an intermediary. Platforms like Upwork guarantee safety, but they charge a commission, which will make the costs higher. If you're looking to overpay for a secure deal, then consider contacting me through freelance marketplaces."/>
					</p>
					<M text="### üìû Step 4: Intermediate interaction"/>
					<p id="freelanceWorkflowItem">
						<M text="Optionally and exclusively for **long-term projects**, I provide intermediate calls or progress reports in any convenient form. The point here is to basically present the deliverable by milestones for subsequent adjustments based on the customer's preferences, and to clarify some details, which can lead to a slightly more accurate result and faster implementation. The effectiveness of such approach comes from an assumption: the increasing deliverable complexity causes increasing complexity of fixing existing components, and therefore customer validation, like product testing, should be done iteratively."/>
						<M text="It's possible to organize a private GitHub/GitLab repository for real-time version tracking."/>
					</p>
					<M text="### ‚úÖ Step 5: Release, post-payment and feedback"/>
					<p id="freelanceWorkflowItem">
						<M text="When completed, a **full version** of the product will be delivered, then you make a post-payment. In some cases (usually with new clients) I offer a **demo version** before post-payment is made ‚Äî this depends on the complexity and type of project. For **hourly rates** with loyal clients, 100% post-payment is formed after calculating the total number of hours worked."/>
						<M text="Like any freelancer, I value testimonials and therefore offer a **discount of 10% off post-payment** for your feedback and references after any gig."/>
					</p>
					<M text="### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 6: Technical support"/>
					<p id="freelanceWorkflowItem">
						<M text="To keep my customers completely satisfied, I provide **free support** for the developed projects: 3 months for business and 1 month for individuals. This consists of consulting and basic troubleshooting. Sometimes simple debugging may also be free."/>
					</p>
					<M text="### üç™ Let's cooperate further"/>
					<p id="freelanceWorkflowItem">
						<M text="I keep in touch with my former customers. You can always contact me if something needs to be improved. For me, relationships with customers and their satisfaction are important, because, in Data Science, it's *much* easier and faster to work with returning clients than to constantly look for new ones."/>
						<M text="To keep clients coming back, I offer some discounts. Loyal customers can expect **lower pricing** for services and **lower upfront fees**, up to 100% postpaid."/>
